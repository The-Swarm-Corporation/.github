Welcome to the Swarms Github Page! 

Our mission is to advance the transition to an agentic world economy with billions of agents, orchestrating and collaborating to solve complex problems and drive innovation.

## Mission

At Swarms, we believe in the power of autonomous agents to revolutionize industries, optimize processes, and create a more efficient and innovative world. Our goal is to build and deploy agent-based systems that can autonomously manage tasks, interact seamlessly with other agents, and operate in dynamic environments to achieve goals with minimal human intervention.

## Hiring

We are expanding our team and looking for talented individuals passionate about building the future of autonomous agents. We have open positions for:

- **Agent Engineers**: Design and develop sophisticated agents capable of complex decision-making and collaboration.
- **DevOps Engineers**: Implement and manage our infrastructure to ensure seamless deployment and operation of our agent systems.
- **Front-End Programmers**: Create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces to interact with our agent frameworks.
- **API Engineers**: Develop robust APIs to facilitate interaction between agents and external systems.
- **AI Researchers**: Innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible with AI and machine learning in the context of agent systems.
